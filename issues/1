# CI test-unit job failing - tests/unit directory not found

## Bug Description
The CI pipeline unit test job is failing because the `tests/unit` directory does not exist in the repository.

## Failing Job Details
- **Job URL**: https://github.com/FabsHof/diagno_ml/actions/runs/21522209739/job/62016234323
- **Commit**: a85e28fbd498c04096a61e074a2e3b95f00f4e14
- **Job**: 🧪 Unit Tests
- **Workflow**: CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Error Message
```
ERROR: file or directory not found: tests/unit

collecting ... collected 0 items

============================ no tests ran in 0.01s =============================
##[error]Process completed with exit code 4.
```

## Root Cause
The pytest command on line 100 of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is trying to run:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit \
  -v \
  --cov=src \
  --cov-report=xml \
  --cov-report=term-missing \
  -m "unit"
```

However, the `tests/unit` directory does not exist in the repository at the failing commit, causing pytest to exit with code 4.

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Create the missing directory structure (Recommended)
Create the `tests/unit` directory and add at least one test file:

```bash
mkdir -p tests/unit
touch tests/unit/__init__.py
```

Then create a test file, e.g., `tests/unit/test_example.py`:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_example():
    """Example unit test."""
    assert True
```

### Option 2: Update the workflow to handle missing directories
Modify the workflow at line 98-105 to make the test step optional:

```yaml
- name: Run unit tests
  run: |
    if [ -d "tests/unit" ]; then
      uv run pytest tests/unit \
        -v \
        --cov=src \
        --cov-report=xml \
        --cov-report=term-missing \
        -m "unit"
    else
      echo "No unit tests directory found, skipping..."
    fi
```

### Option 3: Change the pytest path
If tests are located elsewhere, update line 100 to point to the correct directory (e.g., `tests/` instead of `tests/unit`).

## Impact
- Blocking CI pipeline
- Dependent jobs (integration tests, docker-build, CI success check) are affected
- May prevent merges if branch protection is enabled

## Additional Context
The workflow also references `tests/integration` for integration tests (line 148), so you'll likely need to create that directory structure as well.
