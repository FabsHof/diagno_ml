## Bug Description
The CI pipeline typecheck job is failing with the error:
```
mypy: can't read file 'src': No such file or directory
```

## Failing Job Details
- **Job URL**: https://github.com/FabsHof/diagno_ml/actions/runs/21522209739/job/62016234328
- **Commit**: a85e28fbd498c04096a61e074a2e3b95f00f4e14
- **Job**: 🔬 Type Check
- **Workflow**: CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Root Cause
The mypy command on line 55 of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is trying to run:
```bash
uv run mypy src/
```

However, the `src` directory does not exist at the failing commit, causing the typecheck job to fail with exit code 2.

## Proposed Solution
1. Verify that the `src` directory exists and contains the source code
2. If the source code is located in a different directory, update line 55 in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to point to the correct path
3. Ensure the `src` directory is not accidentally ignored by `.gitignore`

## Impact
- Blocking CI pipeline
- All dependent jobs (integration tests, CI success check) are affected
- Main branch protection may prevent merges until resolved

## Additional Context
- Other jobs in the workflow (lint, security) may have similar issues if they reference the `src` directory
- Line 73 also references `src/` for the bandit security scan
- Lines 102 and 150 reference `src` for coverage reports
